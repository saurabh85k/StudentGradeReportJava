# StudentGradeReportJava
A simple Java console application that manages student grade reports. It takes student names and their marks as input, calculates the total, average, highest, and lowest scores, and then displays a detailed grade report. This project demonstrates array handling, cloning, sorting, and basic input/output in Java.
